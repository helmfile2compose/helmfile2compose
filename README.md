Convert Kubernetes manifests to `compose.yml` + `Caddyfile`.

Takes standard K8s manifests and produces a working Docker Compose setup with Caddy as reverse proxy, so you can run your stack locally (or hobby-grade) without Kubernetes.

**The generated `compose.yml` is a build artifact — never edit it directly.** All configuration goes in `helmfile2compose.yaml`; re-run the script to regenerate.

Vibe-coded with Claude, because maintaining two deployment systems by hand wasn't happening.

### But why?

I love helmfile. I love Kubernetes. But people keep asking me for a docker-compose for my community projects, and I'm not going to maintain both by hand.

There are dozens of tools that go from Compose to Kubernetes ([Kompose](https://github.com/kubernetes/kompose), [Compose Bridge](https://docs.docker.com/compose/bridge/), [Move2Kube](https://move2kube.konveyor.io/), etc.) — that's the "normal" direction. Almost nothing goes the other way, because who would design their deployment in K8s first and then downgrade?

Well, me. My source of truth is the helmfile. The compose is a build artifact. And yes, using Kubernetes manifests as an intermediate representation to generate a docker-compose is absolutely using an ICBM to kill flies — which is exactly why I find it satisfying.

### Does it require helmfile?

No. Despite the name, the core of the tool converts **any Kubernetes manifests** to compose. Helmfile is just one way to produce them. `--from-dir` accepts any directory of `.yaml` files:

```bash
# From helmfile
helmfile -e local template --output-dir /tmp/manifests
# From helm
helm template myrelease mychart -f values.yaml --output-dir /tmp/manifests
# From kustomize
kustomize build ./overlay -o /tmp/manifests/
```

Then point the tool at it:

```bash
python3 helmfile2compose.py --from-dir /tmp/manifests --output-dir ./compose
```

The `--helmfile-dir` flag is a convenience shortcut that runs `helmfile template` for you — nothing more.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- `pyyaml`
- `helmfile` + `helm` (only if rendering from helmfile directly)

## Usage

```bash
# From helmfile directly
python3 helmfile2compose.py --helmfile-dir ~/my-platform -e local --output-dir ./compose

# From pre-rendered manifests (skip helmfile)
helmfile -e local template --output-dir /tmp/rendered
python3 helmfile2compose.py --from-dir /tmp/rendered --output-dir ./compose
```

### Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--helmfile-dir` | Directory containing `helmfile.yaml` or `helmfile.yaml.gotmpl` (default: `.`) |
| `-e`, `--environment` | Helmfile environment (e.g. `local`, `production`) |
| `--from-dir` | Skip helmfile, read pre-rendered YAML from this directory |
| `--output-dir` | Where to write output files (default: `.`) |
| `--compose-file` | Name of the generated compose file (default: `compose.yml`) |

### Output files

- `compose.yml` -- services (incl. Caddy reverse proxy), volumes
- `Caddyfile` -- reverse proxy config derived from Ingress manifests
- `helmfile2compose.yaml` -- persistent config ([reference](docs/architecture.md#config-file-helmfile2composeyaml))
- `configmaps/` -- generated files from ConfigMap volume mounts
- `secrets/` -- generated files from Secret volume mounts

## Documentation

- **[Architecture](docs/architecture.md)** — pipeline, conversion table, config file reference, K8s vs Compose differences and gotchas
- **[Usage guide](docs/usage-guide.md)** — day-to-day operations: regenerating, data management, troubleshooting

## Compatible projects

These are the projects that caused this tool to exist — helmfile was the source of truth, then people asked for a docker-compose. Both ship a `generate-compose.sh` that downloads helmfile2compose from a pinned release, and a `helmfile2compose.yaml` template that handles project-specific gotchas (image overrides, volume mappings, port ranges, etc.).

### [stoatchat-platform](https://github.com/baptisterajaut/stoatchat-platform)

A chat platform (Revolt fork) deployed via helmfile: API, events, file server, proxy, web client, MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ, MinIO, LiveKit. **15 services running** via helmfile2compose.

Notable config: shared `Revolt.toml` ConfigMap across 8 services, bitnami Redis replaced with vanilla via `overrides:`, MinIO bucket init via custom `services:`, S3 path-style via `replacements:`.

### [suite-helmfile](https://github.com/suitenumerique) (La Suite)

A collaborative suite (~16 Helm charts): docs, drive, meet, people, conversations, keycloak, minio, postgresql, redis, livekit. **22 services + 11 init jobs running** via helmfile2compose.

Notable config: wildcard excludes, automatic alias resolution across charts, Job conversion for Django migrations, replicas:0 auto-skip for disabled apps.
