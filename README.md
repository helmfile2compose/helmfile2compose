Convert `helmfile template` output to `compose.yml` + `Caddyfile`.

Takes Kubernetes manifests rendered by helmfile and produces a working Docker Compose setup with Caddy as reverse proxy, so you can run your stack locally (or hobby-grade) without Kubernetes.

**The generated `compose.yml` is a build artifact — never edit it directly.** All configuration goes in `helmfile2compose.yaml`; re-run the script to regenerate.

Docker Compose is easy to understand but hard to maintain at scale. If you're running anything beyond a dev/hobby setup, you should really be using Kubernetes. This tool exists precisely so you don't have to maintain a compose by hand alongside your helmfile (or for my case, my community helmfiles).

Vibe-coded with Claude, because maintaining two deployment systems by hand wasn't happening.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- `pyyaml`
- `helmfile` + `helm` (only if rendering from helmfile directly)

## Usage

```bash
# From helmfile directly
python3 helmfile2compose.py --helmfile-dir ~/my-platform -e local --output-dir ./compose

# From pre-rendered manifests (skip helmfile)
helmfile -e local template --output-dir /tmp/rendered
python3 helmfile2compose.py --from-dir /tmp/rendered --output-dir ./compose
```

### Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--helmfile-dir` | Directory containing `helmfile.yaml` or `helmfile.yaml.gotmpl` (default: `.`) |
| `-e`, `--environment` | Helmfile environment (e.g. `local`, `production`) |
| `--from-dir` | Skip helmfile, read pre-rendered YAML from this directory |
| `--output-dir` | Where to write output files (default: `.`) |
| `--compose-file` | Name of the generated compose file (default: `compose.yml`) |

### Output files

- `compose.yml` -- services (incl. Caddy reverse proxy), volumes
- `Caddyfile` -- reverse proxy config derived from Ingress manifests
- `helmfile2compose.yaml` -- persistent config (see below)
- `configmaps/` -- generated files from ConfigMap volume mounts
- `secrets/` -- generated files from Secret volume mounts

## What it converts

| K8s kind | Compose equivalent |
|----------|-------------------|
| Deployment / StatefulSet | `services:` (image, env, command, volumes, ports) |
| Job | `services:` with `restart: on-failure` (migrations, superuser creation) |
| ConfigMap / Secret | Resolved inline into `environment:` + generated as files for volume mounts |
| Service (ClusterIP) | Hostname rewriting (K8s Service name → compose service name) |
| Service (ExternalName) | Resolved through alias chain (e.g. `docs-media` → minio) |
| Service (NodePort / LoadBalancer) | `ports:` mapping |
| Ingress | Caddy service + Caddyfile `reverse_proxy` blocks (path-rewrite annotations → `uri strip_prefix`) |
| PVC | Named volumes in `helmfile2compose.yaml` |

## Config file (`helmfile2compose.yaml`)

Created on first run, preserved across re-runs. Edit it to control volume mappings and exclusions.

```yaml
helmfile2ComposeVersion: v1
name: my-platform           # compose project name (default: source dir basename)
volume_root: ./data         # prefix for bare host_path names (default: ./data)
caddy_email: admin@example.com  # optional — for Caddy automatic HTTPS

volumes:
  data-postgresql:
    driver: local          # named docker volume
  myapp-data:
    host_path: app         # → ./data/app (bare name = volume_root + name)
  other:
    host_path: ./custom    # explicit path (starts with ./ or /), used as-is

exclude:
  - prometheus-operator    # skip this workload

replacements:               # string replacements in generated files and env vars (port remaps are automatic)
  - old: 'path_style_buckets = false'
    new: 'path_style_buckets = true'

overrides:                  # shallow merge into generated services
  redis-master:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    command: ["redis-server", "--requirepass", "$secret:redis:redis-password"]
    volumes: ["$volume_root/redis:/data"]
    environment: null       # null deletes the key

services:                   # custom services (not from K8s manifests)
  minio-init:
    image: quay.io/minio/mc:latest
    restart: on-failure
    entrypoint: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
    command:
      - mc alias set local http://minio:9000 $secret:minio:rootUser $secret:minio:rootPassword
        && mc mb --ignore-existing local/revolt-uploads
```

### Config sections

- **`name`** — compose project name. Auto-set to the source directory basename on first run.
- **`volume_root`** — base path for volume host mounts (default: `./data`). Bare names in `host_path` are prefixed with this. Paths starting with `./` or `/` are used as-is. Auto-discovered PVCs default to `host_path: <pvc_name>` (resolved via `volume_root`).
- **`volumes`** — map PVCs to named volumes or host paths.
- **`exclude`** — skip workloads by name.
- **`replacements`** — global find/replace in generated ConfigMap/Secret files and env vars. Port remapping is now automatic; still useful for non-port rewrites (e.g. `path_style_buckets`).
- **`overrides`** — shallow merge into generated services. Set a key to `null` to delete it. Useful for replacing bitnami images with vanilla ones, or injecting env vars.
- **`services`** — add custom services not derived from K8s manifests. Combined with `restart: on-failure`, useful for one-shot init tasks (e.g. creating S3 buckets) that complement converted K8s Jobs.
- **`$secret:<name>:<key>`** — placeholder syntax in `overrides` and `services` values, resolved from K8s Secret manifests at generation time.
- **`$volume_root`** — placeholder in `overrides` and `services` values, resolved to the `volume_root` config value.
- **`caddy_email`** — optional. If set, generates a global Caddy block `{ email <value> }` for automatic HTTPS certificate provisioning.

On first run, K8s-only workloads (matching `cert-manager`, `ingress`, `reflector`) are auto-excluded with a warning to review.

## Target projects

### [stoatchat-platform](https://github.com/baptisterajaut/stoatchat-platform)

Primary target. A chat platform (Revolt rebrand) deployed via helmfile: API, events, file server, proxy, web client, MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ, MinIO, LiveKit. **15/15 services running** via helmfile2compose.

Stoatchat-specific quirks handled via config:
- All app services mount `Revolt.toml` from a ConfigMap → auto-generated + bind-mounted
- K8s DNS (`*.svc.cluster.local`) rewritten to compose service names
- Redis overridden from bitnami to vanilla (`overrides:` + `$secret:` ref)
- MinIO bucket creation via one-shot `minio-init` service (`services:` + `restart: on-failure`)
- LiveKit internal URL port remapping now automatic (K8s Service port 80 → container 7880)
- S3 `path_style_buckets` flipped to `true` via `replacements:` (compose DNS can't resolve virtual-hosted bucket URLs)

### [suite-helmfile](https://github.com/suitenumerique) (La Suite)

A larger helmfile (~16 charts) for a collaborative suite (docs, drive, people, keycloak, minio, postgresql, redis). **13 services + 5 init jobs running** via helmfile2compose. Validated automatic alias resolution, port remapping, Job conversion, and K8s variable escaping.

## Limitations

Not converted (warning emitted):
- CronJobs
- Init containers, sidecars (takes `containers[0]` only)
- Resource limits / requests, HPA, PDB

Silently ignored (no compose equivalent):
- RBAC, ServiceAccounts, NetworkPolicies, CRDs, Certificates (Certificate, ClusterIssuer, Issuer), IngressClass, Webhooks, Namespaces
- Probes (liveness, readiness, startup) — no healthcheck generation
- Unknown kinds trigger a warning

### Docker/Compose vs Kubernetes gotchas

Some K8s features don't translate to Compose and may require helmfile-side adjustments for the local environment:

- **Large port ranges** — K8s with `hostNetwork` handles thousands of ports natively. Docker creates one iptables/pf rule per port, so a range like 50000-60000 (e.g. WebRTC) will kill your network stack. Reduce the range in your helmfile local values (e.g. 50000-50100).
- **hostNetwork** — K8s pods can bind directly to the host network. In Compose, every exposed port must be mapped explicitly. Services relying on hostNetwork need their ports listed in the Service/NodePort manifest or they won't be reachable.
- **Pod-to-pod networking** — K8s gives each pod an IP; Compose uses a shared bridge network. This mostly works transparently (service names resolve), but multicast/broadcast or raw IP assumptions won't.
- **S3 virtual-hosted style** — AWS SDKs default to virtual-hosted bucket URLs (`bucket-name.s3:9000`). Compose DNS can't resolve dotted hostnames as aliases. Configure your app to use path-style access (`s3:9000/bucket-name`) and use a `replacement` to flip the setting.
- **Service port remapping** — Now automatic. K8s Service port → container port rewriting happens in env vars, configmap files, and Caddyfile upstreams.
- **K8s `$(VAR)` in commands** — Kubelet-style variable interpolation in container command/args is now resolved at generation time.
- **Shell `$VAR` escaping** — Shell variable references in command/entrypoint are escaped (`$$`) so compose doesn't substitute them from host env.
